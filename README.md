<h1>About this project</h1>


Admissions Power is an "All In One" application and admissions portal where students seeking admissions to a program can sign up, log on, submit an application and eventually view the result of that application. The idea for this application came directly from my most immediate work experience as an admissions counselor. Feel free to view a walkthrough of the working application here: https://youtu.be/kgVwHehp7v0. My rails project will conclude the series where I will launch the application on a web platform for all to use and explore. 

<h1>Installation</h1>

Simply fork the repo, then clone and run on your local machine that is enabled with RUBY
You must run shotgun and have required gems installed. This can be done with Bundle install.
